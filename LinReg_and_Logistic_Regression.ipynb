        "If you are familiar with NumPy, you can skip reading this section.\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation of linear regression and logistic regression is based on Python and Numpy. Numpy use `np.ndarray` to represent vectors and matrices. However, if you are not familiar with Numpy, the shape issues might be quite often during your implementation. Therefore, we provide the following tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Print the shapes when you are not sure or a bug happens. Given a `np.ndarray` object, you can always get its shape using `.shape` attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "```py\n",
        "data = np.array([1,2,3])\n",
        "print(data.shape)\n",
        "```\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "```\n",
        ">>> (3,)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "```py\n",
        "data = np.array([[1,2,3]])\n",
        "print(data.shape)\n",
        "```\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "```\n",
        ">>> (1, 3)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Representing row/column vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Note: this is just one way to manage the shape of vector/matrices. You do not have to follow this if you are already familiar with NumPy).\n",
        "\n",
        "In numpy, the shape (n,) is different from the shape (n, 1), although two arrays with shape (n,) and (n, 1) have the same number of elements. We recommend creating row/column vectors with the shape (n, 1) and (1, n), which could help you better manage the matrix/vector multiplication. For example, to create a row vector, you may use the following code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```py\n",
        "# shape (3,)\n",
        "row_vector = np.array([1,2,3])\n",

        "\n",
        "print(row_vector.shape)\n",
        "```\n",
        "The shape will be (1, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "This will be useful when you represent the features of your input data, the target labels, and the model parameters. For example, assume you have $5$ data points, each with dimension $10$. Then they can be represented as a 2D array:\n",
        "\n",
        "```py\n",
        "data = np.random.rand(5, 10)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Their corresponding labels, assuming each of them is a real number, can be represented as an array with shape (5,) or (5, 1):\n",

        "# shape (5,)\n",
        "labels = np.random.rand(5)\n",
        "shape (5,1)\n",
        "labels = labels.reshape(5, 1)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Vector/matrix multiplicatin.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you represent vectors using the above way (always add an extra empty axis), you should be careful about the vector/matrix multiplicatin.\n",

        "```py\n",
        "# shape (3,)\n",
        "vector_c = np.array([1,2,3])\n",

        "print(res.shape)\n",
        "```\n",
        "The output shape will be [1, 2]. It is still a 2D array, not a vector with shape (2, )\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, if you multiple a row vector with a column vector, both of which have an extra empty axis:\n",
        "\n",
