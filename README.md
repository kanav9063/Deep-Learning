# Learning Deep Learning by Building

This repository documents my journey of learning deep learning by implementing various models from scratch and working through assignments. It includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover fundamental concepts and popular deep learning architectures.

## Projects and Concepts

Here is a summary of the projects and concepts covered in this repository:

### 1. Building a Basic GPT from Scratch (`BuildingABasicGPTFromScratch.ipynb`)

This notebook walks through the process of building a basic GPT-2 model from scratch.

- **Concepts**: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), tokenization, self-attention, transformer blocks, model training, and text generation.
- **Dataset**: Shakespeare.

### 2. Character-level RNN (`CharRNN.ipynb`)

This project focuses on implementing a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in PyTorch for text generation.

- **Concepts**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), character-level language modeling, text generation.
- **Datasets**: Shakespeare and Linux kernel code.

### 3. Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification (`CNN.ipynb` and `CNN2.ipynb`)

These notebooks implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- **Concepts**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), image classification, data augmentation, model training and evaluation.
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10.

### 4. Multi-class Text Classification with PyTorch (`multi_pytorch.ipynb`)

This notebook implements a multi-class text classification model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

- **Concepts**: Multi-class classification, bag-of-words, text preprocessing, PyTorch for NLP.
- **Dataset**: SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).

### 5. Multi-class and Kernel Logistic Regression (`Multi_class_logistic_regression.ipynb`)

This notebook covers two classification tasks:

- **Kernel Trick**: Explores the use of the kernel trick for two-class classification on non-linear data.
- **Multi-class Logistic Regression**: Implements multi-class logistic regression to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Concepts**: Logistic regression, kernel trick, multi-class classification, gradient descent.
- **Datasets**: Scikit-learn moons dataset, MNIST.

### 6. Introduction to PyTorch (`Pytorch_intro.ipynb`)

A comprehensive tutorial on the fundamentals of PyTorch.

- **Concepts**: Tensors, Autograd (automatic differentiation), `torch.nn` module for building neural networks, and `torch.utils.data` for data loading.

### 7. Linear and Logistic Regression (`LinReg_and_Logistic_Regression_Drive.ipynb`)

This notebook covers the implementation of simple linear and logistic regression models from scratch.

- **Concepts**: Linear regression, logistic regression, gradient descent.
